        # Using Quilt?


        This mod is built exclusively for *Fabric*. 


        This means it's **not compatible** with *Quilt*, as the underlying code
        structures (APIs) differ between the two systems. Trying to force it to
        work with Quilt will lead to mixin conflicts and likely cause crashes or
        unexpected issues.


        This is a *Fabric* mod, therefore you should use the *Fabric Loader* to
        use it. It's as simple as that!


        I understand some users might prefer Quilt, and there's nothing wrong
        with that. However, please be aware that **I cannot troubleshoot or fix
        problems** that happen specifically because you're trying to run a
        *Fabric* mod on *Quilt*. 


        **My time and resources are focused on ensuring the mod works smoothly
        within its intended environment.**
